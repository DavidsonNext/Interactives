        <text>
            <p>Rank the electric potential difference between the following pairs of points from 1 to 5, with 5 representing the greatest electric potential difference. If two pairs of points tie, give them the same rank. If all of the pairs of points have the same potential difference rank them all as 5. If all of the pairs of points have zero potential difference, rank them all as 1. Negative values of potential difference are less than zero.</p>

  <solution>
<div class="detailed-solution">
<p>Explanation</p>

<p>The field is uniform, meaning that it has the same strength and direction everywhere between the plates. The electric potential varies with the vertical position, but not with the horizontal position. Positions closer to the plate carrying a net positive charge are higher in potential than positions closer to the bottom plate, which carries a net negative charge. When the first point is closer to the positive plate and the second point is closer to the negative plate, the change in electric potential, the electric potential difference is negative. When the first point is closer to the negative plate and the second point is closer to the positive plate, the electric potential difference is positive.</p> 

<p>The change from C to B is the largest positive change in potential difference, since it is a distance towards the positive plate of two vertical gridlines. The change from E to D is also a positive change, but only of one grid line, so it ranks second. From C to D is along a horizontal gridline. This is equivalent to moving along an isoline of equal potential, or zero change in potential. From D to E is a negative change of one vertical gridline. A to B involves the same negative change in vertical position of two grid lines as moving the test charge from B to C. Since both involve a change from farther away to closer to the negative plate, those two potential differences are the same negative value, the smallest value in the exercise.
